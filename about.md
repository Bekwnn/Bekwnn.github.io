Hi, my name is Evan Nickerson and I go by Bekwnn online. I'm a game developer and computer
graphics programmer. I mainly work with Unreal Engine 4, Unity, and OpenGL. I graduated from
University of Victoria with a BSc in Computer Science with Computer Graphics option. I make
games, tinker with experiments, and exercise my creativity through my programming.
