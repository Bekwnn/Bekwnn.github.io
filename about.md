I go by Bekwnn and I'm a game developer and computer graphics programmer. I mainly work with Unreal Engine 4, Unity, and OpenGL. I graduated from University of Victoria
with a BSc in Computer Science with Computer Graphics option. I make games, tinker with experiments, and exercise my creativity through my programming.
