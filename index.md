# What Is This Website About?

This is the home page of me. Bekwnn. I'm a programmer. I mainly do things involving computer graphics and game development.
For a bit more about me, check out the [about]({{ site.baseurl }}/about) page. Otherwise, this page houses a collection of
topics I've written about and other stuff I've done. Feel free to poke around the site to see if anything interests you.
